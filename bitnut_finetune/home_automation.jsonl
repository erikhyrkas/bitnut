So, use a secure Wi-Fi network that you've set up yourself.\n\n3. Keep Your Devices Updated: Just like you get new treats for your birthday, your devices need updates too. These updates make your devices stronger and less likely to be hacked.\n\n4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication: This is like adding an extra layer of security, like a collar with a bell. It's extra work, but it's worth it because hackers need the key to your door.\n\n5. Be Careful with Your Devices: Don't open random files or apps on your devices, just like you don't eat random treats. It's always good to ask for permission first.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to be careful and never give out your secret codes. Treats and security can be fun, but never trade your safety for something that can get you into trouble. Stay safe, everyone!"}
